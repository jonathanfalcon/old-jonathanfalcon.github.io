# What is the McCombs Marketing Conference?

Hosted nearly every year, the McCombs Marketing Conference is a look into the world of marketing, both right now and towards the future. The Marketing Challenge, as part of this conference, allows teams of first-year MBA and MS Marketing students—that's me—to put to use our burgeoning skills and learnings based on a provided business case. Our team had just *one week* from October 19 to conduct research, hone strategies and tactics, and create an impactful presentation.

# Background

## The Situation

One of the world's leading tech companies, Samsung Electronics manufactures and markets a breadth of electronics. In particular, their mobile portfolio—which includes the Samsung Galaxy phones—sold over *272 million* units globally in 2021. Samsung also has an opportunity to gather a greater share of Gen-Z in the United States, however research indicated that Gen-Z women lag Gen-Z men in preference for Samsung Galaxy. To combat the discrepancy, Samsung introduced the *Foldables* portfolio. Desirable features and the portfolio's compactness aim to attract Gen-Z women.

## The Challenge

Samsung posed the following questions to us:

1. What can Samsung do strategically to increase consideration of its Galaxy portfolio with Gen-Z women?
2. Which devices should Samsung prioritize to drive consideration?
    - Smartphone
    - Tablet
    - Audio
    - Smartwatch
3. What impact could this have on adoption of Samsung’s mobile enhancement portfolio (Buds and Watch)?

# Our Presentation

Following a rigorous week of occasionally twelve-hour days, we presented our findings and recommendations.

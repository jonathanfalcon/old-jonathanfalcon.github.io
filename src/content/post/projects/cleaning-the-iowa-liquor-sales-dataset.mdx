# Background

This data is taken from the State of Iowa's publicly available data website. It was and still is collected by the Iowa Department of Commerce, Alcoholic Beverages Division, who publishes the data. The page for the dataset can be accessed here: [https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy.](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy) 


The data I'll be working with is the following:

<Table>

| Zip Code             | `zipCode`       | Zip code where the store who ordered the liquor is located                           |
| Store Number         | `store`         | Unique number assigned to the store who ordered the liquor                           |
| Vendor Number        | `vendor`        | The vendor number of the company for the brand of liquor ordered                     |

| Item Description     | `item`          | Description of the individual liquor product ordered                                 |
| Sales (Dollars)      | `sales`         | Total cost of liquor order (number of bottles multiplied by the state bottle retail) |
| State Bottle Cost    | `bottleCost`    | The amount that Alcoholic Beverages Division paid for each bottle of liquor ordered  |
| State Bottle Retail  | `bottleRetail`  | The amount the store paid for each bottle of liquor ordered                          |

# Preliminaries

## Loading the Required Libraries

These two libraries are required to better work with the data.

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## Reading in and Sampling the Data

Here, we first create a named vector, consisting of the desired names for our columns and the names of the columns in the dataset.

```r
selectedVars <- c(date = "Date",
                  store = "Store Number",
                  city = "City",
                  county = "County",
                  vendor = "Vendor Number",
                  bottleCost = "State Bottle Cost",
                  bottleRetail = "State Bottle Retail",
                  zipCode = "Zip Code",
                  category = "Category Name",
                  item = "Item Description",
                  sales = "Sale (Dollars)")
```

Next, we read in the dataset using a `readr` function and pass it using a pipe `%>%` to a `dplyr` function to sample a fraction of the dataset, as working with a 6 *gigabyte* file is needlessly time-consuming. This function samples 25% of the available data.

```r
liquorSales <- read_delim("./Data/Iowa_Liquor_Sales_Sample.tsv",
                          col_select = all_of(selectedVars),
                          col_types = cols("Zip Code" = "c",
                                           "Store Number" = "c",
                                           "Vendor Number" = "c")) %>%
  sample_frac(0.25)
```

# Cleaning the Data

## Converting `date` to Date Format

This step is relatively simple, but extremely important if we are to perform any time-series analyses.

```r
liquorSales$date <- mdy(liquorSales$date)
```

## Collapsing the Liquor Categories
There were too many different categories of liquor for any meaningful analyses, so collapsing the categories into twelve categories makes it easier. The exact item is still preserved though.

This first step creates a named vector like earlier. The name is structured as a regular expressionâ€”regex for short.

Breaking it down, `.*` means any character `.` zero or more times `*`. The vertical bar `|` is short for "or" in this case, e.g., `tequila OR mezcal`. All together, this finds matches for broad categories of alcohol.

```r
patternList <- c(".*vodka.*" = "Vodka",
                 ".*schnapps.*" = "Schnapps",
                 ".*rum.*" = "Rum",
                 ".*tequila|mezcal.*" = "Tequila",
                 ".*gin.*" = "Gin",
                 ".*whisk|scotch|bourbon.*" = "Whiskey/Whisky",
                 ".*brand.*" = "Brandy",
                 ".*liqueur|cordial|creme|triple|anisette|amaretto.*" = "Liqueur/Cordial",
                 ".*spirit.*" = "Spirit",
                 ".*cocktail|rock.*" = "Cocktail",
                 ".*beer.*" = "Beer",
                 ".*special|american alcohol|delisted|holiday|iowa.*" = "Misc")
```

Here, we use a `for` loop to iterate over each broad category of alcohol listed above, searching for and substituting regex matches with the corresponding values. For example, categories that have some form of tequila or mezcal in it will be reassigned "Tequila."

```r
for (n in 1:length(patternList)) {
  liquorSales$category <- liquorSales$category %>%
    gsub(pattern = names(patternList[n]), ignore.case = TRUE, replacement = patternList[[n]])
}
```

All together, this section aimed to condense the number of alcohol categories to provide a more reasonable amount to analyze.


## Manually Assigning Liquor Categories Based on Item

Now, admittedly, this section used pure brute force. Is there a more elegant and efficient solution? Perhaps, but I couldn't find it in time.

In this first part, we select the `category` and `item` columns from `liquorSales`, keep observations with missing categories, group by `item`, and count the number of observations by that grouping variable `item`. Lastly, we sort the summary by the `item` count descending.

```r
liquorSales %>%
  select(category, item) %>%
  filter(is.na(category)) %>%
  group_by(item) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

Using the above

```r
vodka <- "(VODKA|BURNETTS|VAN GOGH|DEEP EDDY|GREY GOOSE|SKYY|PINNACLE|SMIRNOFF|ABSOLUT|SVEDKA|STOLICHNAYA|PEARL|360 |FOREX|BELVEDERE|BURNETT'S|CIROC|KETEL ONE|NEW AMSTERDAM|PRIDE OF THE WAPSI|SOBIESKI|THREE OLIVES|TWENTY GRAND GOLD)"
